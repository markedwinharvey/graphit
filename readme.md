graphit displays data from mathematical expressions as a function of variables x and (optionally) n. 

The limits and intervals of x and n, and the size of each data point, can be changed. Defaults are preloaded. 

By graphing functions over a range of n values (and overlaying each output), interesting patterns begin to emerge. 

Warning: data processing can become memory-intensive during the drawing of complex functions with many data points. As such, it is highly recommended that you clear complicated graphs before drawing on top of them. 

The html gui hopefully makes program operation straightforward. 

** update **

Updated version graphit2.html, in conjunction with graphit2.js, is a simple modification of the original that actively removes data points as they are generated, resulting in more "animated" behavior. Running the program is still CPU-intensive, but there are no longer serious issues with program pauses to clear tens of thousands of points, etc. The program is now more streamlined for interactive experimentation, for easily assessing the graphical output based on changes to the function. The number of visible data points can be altered, along with the range of x and n, and the pixel size.
