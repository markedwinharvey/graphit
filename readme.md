graphit displays data from mathematical expressions as a function of variables x and (optionally) n. 

The limits and intervals of x and n, and the size of each data point, can be changed. Defaults are preloaded. 

By graphing functions over a range of n values (and overlaying each output), interesting patterns begin to emerge. 

Warning: data processing can become memory-intensive during the drawing of complex functions with many data points. As such, it is highly recommended that you clear complicated graphs before drawing on top of them. 

The html gui hopefully makes program operation straightforward.
